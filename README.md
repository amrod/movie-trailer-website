# Project #1: Movie Trailer Website

This website was created as part of the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree.

## Getting started

Download the source from [https://github.com/amrod/movie-trailer-website](https://github.com/amrod/movie-trailer-website)

## Run

To render the site and open it in a web browser, simply run the `entertainment_center.py` file:

```python
python entertainment_center.py
```

A file named `fresh_tomatoes.html` is generated in the same location where `entertainment_center.py` is run from. 
A sample of the rendered page can be seen here: [http://amrod.github.io/movie-trailer-website](http://amrod.github.io/movie-trailer-website/)
